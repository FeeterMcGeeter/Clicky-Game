# Mega Man Memory Game

### Description
This is a memory game built with React using create-react-app... Mega Man style!!
I used components to build the app piece by piece and pieced it all together in the App.js file.  

### Instructions 
This is a game of memory.  Click on an image to start the game.  The goal is to get as far as you can without clicking on the same image twice.  You win the game by clicking on every image only once.  This will be challenging, considering there are 28 images total.. So good luck!

### Built With
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Bootstrap
* JQuery
* Javascript
* NodeJS
* React
    * create-react-app

### Biggest Challenge During the Build
* How I was going to make the images appear in random cards after each click
    * My solution was to write a function that would loop through a list randomly and then passed the list of images through that function.
